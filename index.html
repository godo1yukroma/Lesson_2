			<h2>The purpose of the IQ test</h2>
			<p>The IQ test can be used for many reasons. It allows determining one's level of being able to learn, to
				understand, to form concepts, to process information, to apply logic and reason, in comparison to the
				population. It is indicative and can represent an influence on non-common characters that can be encountered
				in society, whether relational such as isolation, rejection or distance, or intellectual such as ease or
				difficulties encountered in intellectual activities. In another way, it can also explain successes acquired
				in ways easier than others by individuals.</p>
			<h3>The effectiveness of this test</h3>
			<span>The IQ test we offer is used internationally by millions of users and new users take it every day. The
				statistics provided and established by the totality of the results make it possible to verify its
				reliability in relation to the calibration IQ scale system represented by the Gauss Curve.</span>
			<h4>The gifted</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>Curiosity and a thirst for learning: they ask themselves a lot of questions and are able to acquire
					knowledge on their own.</li>
				<li>Perfectionism, the need to do things accurately and excellently.</li>
				<li>The fear of oneself, of who one is, of the consequences of their overflowing thoughts and emotions.</li>
				<li>Interest that sometimes reaches an obsessive level in certain themes.</li>
				<li>Hypersensitivity that is often invisible from the outside.
					<ul>
						<li>A great ability to pay attention and concentrate.</li>
						<li>Meta-cognitive awareness: they know how to identify and reuse plans, concepts and strategies that
							they
							can employ to solve problems.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<h5>The mental handicap</h5>
			<div class="main_text">People with very low intellectual quotients (70) are defined as holders of a mental
				disability disorder and may experience, despite the intensity of work, more difficulty than others in
				intellectual activities and may also maintain, in spite of themselves, difficulties in social behaviours
				despite the strength of their will. The main causes that may explain the development of this disability
				would be nutritional problems during pregnancy or birth problems, such as a lack of oxygen. Exposure to
				certain diseases, such as whooping cough or measles, with delayed care could also explain the mental
				disability.</div>
		</div>
		<h6>Our statistics</h6>
		<p> <mark>We accompany each IQ result with personalised statistics that rank the candidate based on several
				parameters
				(population, age group, level of study, field of study).</mark>

			Our following statistics are derived from our studies of all the candidates on the global scale over several
			years and can evolve, depending on the new results recorded.</p>
